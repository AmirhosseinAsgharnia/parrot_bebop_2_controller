This repository is ROS2 package for path control and opening camera of Parrot Bebop 2. These packages need [ros2_bebop_driver](https://github.com/jeremyfix/ros2_bebop_driver) installed. Since our experiments are being done in a lab equipped with OptiTrack cameras, [ros2-mocap_optitrack](https://github.com/tud-phi/ros2-mocap_optitrack) needs to installed as well. These packages are under extensive developments and are expected to be completed by the end of summer 2025.
